## Getting Started

> Note to Vue users: Vite currently only works with Vue 3.x. This also means you can't use libraries that are not yet compatible with Vue 3.

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine before proceeding.

Click the Use this template button and clone the repository.
